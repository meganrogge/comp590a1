I built the Decoder from scratch and built the Encoder based on the skeleton code. 

The encoder can encode a text file and then the decoder can decode it. The encoder can encode that decoded file and the loop continues!

The main class for the encoder is encoder/HuffEncode and the main class for the decoder is main/DecoderMain
